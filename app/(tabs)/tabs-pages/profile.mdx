#### Biography

I'm a software developer with a passion for both frontend and backend development, always exploring new ways to create intuitive and efficient digital experiences. 
I share my knowledge and insights on programming through my [blog](https://github.com/BillyAddlers), where I enjoy writing about various tech topics. 
My portfolio of projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BillyAddlers), showcasing my journey and growth in the field. 

With a background as a vocational graduate in art, I've combined my artistic sensibilities with my technical skills to create engaging software. 
Currently, I'm in the final semester of university, working on my thesis. Beyond coding, I'm deeply into anime, art, games, music, photography, and, of course, all things Linux.
